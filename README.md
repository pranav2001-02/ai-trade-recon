## AI-powered Trade Reconciliation Workbench

Today, reconciliation in financial institutions is slow, manual, error-prone, and completely non-standardized across systems.

Our solution automates the entire workflow:
  - Schema inference from raw files
  - Auto-mapping of fields into a canonical model
  - Data normalization across systems
  - Deterministic matching to identify exact, partial, and unmatched trades
  - And LLM-driven explanations that clearly tell the analyst why a break occurred and provide a confidence score.

This reduces hours of manual work into seconds and brings explainability and control into reconciliation.

## How it works

**1. Data Upload + Ingestion:** “As a first step, the analyst uploads multiple trade files from different systems. Our system doesn't require any predefined templates or mapping tables. It simply loads the datasets into an in-memory store.”

**2. Canonical Schema Inference:** “When we pick the Golden Source, the LLM looks at just five sample rows and infers a canonical trade schema. This schema is used to normalize every other source without manual configuration.”

**3. Column Mapping + Normalization:** “When we click Run Reconciliation, each source dataset is converted into the canonical model.”

**4. Reconciliation Engine:** We categorize trades into three buckets:
   - Exact Matches: clean alignment (Matches using deterministic hash lookups on primary key)
   - Partial Matches: values differ (calls LLM for explanation)
   - Unmatched: no corresponding trade found

**5. LLM Explainability:** The LLM compares the two records field-by-field and generates:
   - a short explanations
   - a yes/no/maybe verdict
   - a confidence score
   - a one-sentence summary

**6. Human-in-the-Loop Analyst Workflow:** “We enforce mandatory analyst remarks. Every decision is stored in state and associated with that specific record. This brings accountability, auditability, and enables downstream compliance workflows.”

**7. Final Export:** “At the end, analysts export a fully reconciled Excel report. This forms a ready-to-submit regulatory audit file.”

**8. Closing Statement:** “Our solution delivers data harmonization, reconciliation, explainability, and auditability in one workflow. It dramatically reduces reconciliation time and increases middle-office accuracy.”
